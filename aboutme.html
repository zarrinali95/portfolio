    <h2 class = "center align"> Get to Know Me <center> </h2>
    <p> My name is Zarrin, pronounced Zuh-rin. I am a student at The Bronx High School of Science, located in New York City. Some fun things I like to do is indoor skydiving, skateboarding, and coding.
    I am part of an award-winning all-girls robotics team called the FeMaidens and I know a total of 3 languages: English, Spanish, and Arabic. I have been featured in a book called She's so Boss and a documentary called 'The Iron Maidens.' I dislike peanut butter, trains, and loud chewing. Now that you know some stuff about me, welcome to my webpage! </p>

   <h2> <center> Here are Some of the Websites That I Use </center> </h2>:
