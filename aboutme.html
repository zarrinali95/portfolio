    <h2> Get to Know Me </h2>
    <p> My name is Zarrin, pronounced Zuh-rin. I am a student at The Bronx High School of Science, located in New York City. Some fun things I like to do is indoor skydiving, skateboarding, and coding.
    I am part of an award-winning all-girls robotics team called the FeMaidens and can speak a total of 3 languages: English, Spanish, and Arabic. I have been featured in a book called Girl Boss and a documentary called 'The Iron Maidens.' I hope to be a software developer in the future. Welcome to my webpage!
